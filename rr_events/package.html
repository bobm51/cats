contains classes for implementing the input queue.  The Swing documentation
strongly recommends that lengthy processing happen somewhere other than the
Swing dispatch thread.  Furthermore, potential race conditions exist if
the dispatcher is doing something at the same time as an event is received
from the layout.  Therefore, all events are funneled through a queue and the
events are processed in an independent thread.  This makes Swing processing
quick and simple (the Swing events are converted to command objects and
queued).  It also eliminates the possibility of contention beause the queue
serializes events.  Since the queue is a classic producer/consumer problem,
it is synchronized.

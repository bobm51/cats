contains abstract classes for creating mini-databases, which will be called
"stores".  The base store class has two aggregates: a Vector of FieldInfo
and a Vector of records.
<p>
The FieldInfo vector has one element for each field in a record.  The
FieldInfo element describes the field.  The purpose of the FieldInfo
vector is for guiding a Table Editor in editing the contents of the record
vector and in reading and saving the records.  In some cases, it is possible
to add and delete elements from the FieldInfo vector.
<p>
The record vector is the contents of the mini-database.  Each record is
itself a vector.  Each record vector has exactly the same number of elements
as in the FieldInfo vector.
<p>
store objects are intended to be quite simple.  They do not support database
operations like project, join, or even sort.  They support at most a single
key.  The intent is that all manipulation of the contents be done by
a Table Editor.

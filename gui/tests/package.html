is the package containing GUI for running signal tests.
<p>
There are two kinds of tests supported.  The aspect test sets all signals to
the same aspect.  Because a signal may contain multiple heads, the heads
may not show the same colors or positions.  The color test sets all heads
to the same presentation.  However, lights have colors and semaphores have
positions.  So lights are ignored when testing positions and semaphores are
ignored when testing colors.
<p>
A test is ended by refreshing the layout.
